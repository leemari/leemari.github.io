        <p>
        Having graduated from Napier University Edinburgh in 1993 with a degree in computing, I have been developing software as a professional ever since. I currently work for E.ON IT UK Ltd., developing enterprise software bespoke to the Utility industry; this is a mixture of desktop / intranet and backend based solutions.

        <p>
        I began my professional career as a C programmer, moved into Java in 1998 and C# .NET in 2002. I work predominantly on the C# .NET stack but still do a lot of Java.
        </p>
         
        <p>
        I have been doing a technical lead role for the past 12 years; designing solutions, reviewing code, mentoring, making technology decisions, coding etc.

        My real passion over the years has been learning new languages, but these days I am more interested in programming theory and the various programming paradigms. Whilst most of my experience has been with Imperative / Object Oriented paradigms, in the last few years I have come to realize the benefits to adopting the functional paradigm. I have considered numerous languages promoting the functional style of programming (Scala / F# / Racket / ML) I have landed on Clojure as my current pursuit. Clojure runs on a widely adopted and accepted enterprise platform that I am very familiar with, the Java Virtual Machine, and is a LISP style language and I like the simplicity and power that it offers.
